# Block vs Inline

Block elements take up the full wdith of its container 
Block elemets start on a new line 
Divs are for block elements 

Inline elements only takeu the width of its contents 
Inline elememts don't start on a new line

You can wrap words into spans, because span is inline

# Block elemets: 
div, section, p, h1, h2,

# Inline elements: 
a, span, b, strong, em, i, img

tasks: in your portfolio bios, make some words italic using the em or the i tag. Also make some words bold using the strong tags.

then using the inspect panel, hover over those words and notice the width of the elements.
